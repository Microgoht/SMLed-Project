# SMLed-Project
This Project Is Made By HETMG (High End Tv Modding Group) And Not respondible (Sorry for the english its not our main lang) for the damages YOU done by yourself 2:This Project Needs you an LED Backlight Lcd (LE32B550A6W To All B6?? B7?? Series TVS


So Hello This is going to be hard one But we are introducting SMLED (Service Modded Light emitting diokside thingy.) This Project mainly focuses on Having Great Blacks and Mid Range Whites (We Will Open some settings that might make your tv better)
As We began make sure you dont do fatal mistakes (As EEPROM Resetting [Resets ALL Data inculuding Service menu settings you changed and Sometimes Your Mods] And Changing your screen type [What idiot would do that????] 
Now This is On Constroction [Sorry For the english for the 90st time but im going to tell it again its not my main lang im turkish.] And CCFL Lcd is not recommended Please Leave this Project if you use CCFL, Now they left Heres some sneak peaks:
W/b
CE  
Sepco ????? 

Be Ready For this project and feel free to help our group We need more tweakable settings we need (such as more hidden stuff)
We know how to reset the tv Or do internal diagnostic 
Heres some reason why we need these:
1.This would help the group alot on modding
2.This will allow us to show more settings to more users
3.Maybe these would be added to samygos website (which we dream of:D)
